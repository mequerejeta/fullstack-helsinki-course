# fullstack-helsinki-course
This repository was created to upload my exercises from the University of Helsinki's Full Stack Open course.

The course page can be found [here](https://fullstackopen.com/en/), where I will be learning React, Redux, Node.js, MongoDB, GraphQL, and TypeScript. The main focus of the course is on building single-page applications with ReactJS that utilize REST APIs built with Node.js.
